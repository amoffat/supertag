Usage
#####

Most operations are going to have 3 distinct ways of them:

#. Using a file browser GUI
#. Using a standard commandline program
#. Using the ``tag`` binary

Which method you choose will depend on your personal preference. For example, if you're not a commandline person,
you will probably do most of your operations with the file browser GUI. On the other hand, if you *are* proficient on
the commandline, you'll probably use standard commandline programs, like ``mkdir``, ``ln``, etc. But for some
operations, the ``tag`` binary gives you some extra functionality that you can't get with standard commandline
functions.

We'll go through each of the operations, as well as each of the 3 ways of accomplishing them, if applicable.

The first thing you'll want to do is mount the filesystem, so start :ref:`here <mounting>`.
